# VACANZA

Welcome to my Midstone project for NSS Software Engineering, VACANZA. This project was a group project that took place during April 2023.
The Initial Project instructions for deliverables, setup, objectives, etc. are located in the resources folder. 

With the back-end work in Java, front-end in Javascript and design using HTML/CSS, this project is a Full-Stack serverless application that provides users 
with a place to store and create itineraries and activities for vacation planning.

Feel free to contact me regarding any questions/concerns.
