# Team Charter

## Purpose

* Dependability

* Meaning
* Impact

### Team Members

- _Allyssa Mikes_
- _Chase Fowler_
- _Neal Aites_
- _Erin Geier_

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
Debate differences that may arise and see the benefits of various approaches. Listen to everyone’s contributions. If things break, focus on solving the issue. Emphasize the value of achieving common goals, rather than individual contributions.




* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
Always know that no one wants a fellow team member to feel this way, and be observant of fellow teammates.




### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  Stay organized, stay motivated



* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
We will start it first thing next morning, after discussing what went wrong.


* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
Team wide access to the document detailing exactly what the team has come up with. Regularly check in and clarify. Daily standups and check ins at end of day to address delays if they come along. Tickets for tasks created and updated in GitHub.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  A chance to experience what working in an SDE environment is like, if only a glimpse.
  To develop a project you can use to demonstrate the skills we have learned in the past 5 months.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve? What will be true when you have 'succeeded' on this project?**
Prioritize what we’ve outlined so far, and do it well. We have identified extensions and will work towards them if time allows.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
Team work, front end programming and design, how to put together all the pieces of an application from the front end to the back end, techniques for effective project planning. Deploying.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  Morning standups 10-15 minutes daily,
  Ongoing communication of obstacles,
  End of day wrap up for 10 mins,
  Responsibility for issues individualized, but with group support if necessary

## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about becoming an SDE?**

* _Allyssa Mikes_: I enjoy working through the code bases, and working on projects. Having an end goal is exciting.
* _Chase Fowler_: I like creating something and seeing it work in the end
* _Neal Aites_: Continuing to challenge myself and master new skills
* _Erin Geier_: I enjoy coding. I liked working with a technical team. I like solving problems and working independently toward collective goals.

**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak up less, etc.**

* _Allyssa Mikes_: I need to work on my focus, I lose focus and get distracted too often.
* _Chase Fowler_: I want to improve my teamwork, project management, and testing skills, and learn some frontend design
* _Neal Aites_: Project/time management skills and technical skills  are something I am always seeking to improve.
* _Erin Geier_: Communication is my weakest point. I feel that my ability to talk about technical skills is undeveloped. I can see that I sometimes use too little jargon or use terms imprecisely. When I try to explain things, I feel like I end up confusing things for others sometimes.
